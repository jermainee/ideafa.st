# ðŸ’© IdeaFast

_The fastest way to a bad SaaS idea._

## âš¡ What is this?

IdeaFast is a brutally efficient, absolutely unnecessary and accidentally inspiring idea generator for SaaS startups that should probably never exist.
It delivers **100% nonsense**, **0% VC funding** and **one random idea at a time** â€“ because your next unicorn should start with a ðŸ’© joke.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why does this exist?

Because some people spend **months** brainstorming their startup idea... and you don't have time for that.
You need **a dumb idea, right now** â€“ one you can ironically pitch on Twitter, launch on Product Hunt, showcase on r/SaaS and maybe accidentally raise $2M for.
